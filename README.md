# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML-


* in this project i will employ several supervised algorithms of my choice to accurately model individuals 'income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. i will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results . 

* my goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. 

* The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid". You can find the article by Ron Kohavi online. The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the 'fnlwgt' feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.
